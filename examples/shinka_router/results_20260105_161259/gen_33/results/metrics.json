    "text_feedback": "# Example of an AIME problem that could not be answered correctly:\n\nAlice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to analyze the winning and losing positions in the game played by Alice and Bob. \n\nWe define a position as a losing position if the player whose turn it is to play cannot force a win with optimal play from the opponent. Conversely, a position is a winning position if the player can force a win regardless of how the opponent plays.\n\nLet's denote the position with \\( n \\) tokens as a losing position \\( L \\) if from that position, any move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position \\( W \\) is one where at least one move leads to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nWe can construct the winning and losing positions systematically:\n\n- For \\( n = 0 \\): This is a losing position \\( L(0) \\) because there are no tokens to remove.\n- For \\( n = 1 \\): Alice removes 1 token, leaving 0 for Bob. So, \\( W(1) \\).\n- For \\( n = 2 \\): Alice removes 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who can win. So, \\( W(2) \\).\n- For \\( n = 3 \\): Alice removes 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob, who can win. So, \\( W(3) \\).\n- For \\( n = 4 \\): Alice removes 4 tokens, leaving 0 for Bob. So, \\( W(4) \\).\n- For \\( n = 5 \\): Alice can remove 1 token (leaving 4), or 4 tokens (leaving 1). Both lead to winning positions for Bob. Thus, \\( L(5) \\).\n- For \\( n = 6 \\): Alice can remove 1 token (leaving 5, a losing position for Bob). Thus, \\( W(6) \\).\n- For \\( n = 7 \\): Alice can remove 1 token (leaving 6), leading to a win for Bob. Thus, \\( W(7) \\).\n- For \\( n = 8 \\): Alice can remove 4 tokens (leaving 4, a winning position for Bob). Thus, \\( W(8) \\).\n- For \\( n = 9 \\): Alice can remove 1 token (leaving 8), or 4 tokens (leaving 5). Thus, \\( L(9) \\).\n- For \\( n = 10 \\): Alice can remove 1 token (leaving 9), a losing position for Bob. Thus, \\( W(10) \\).\n- For \\( n = 11 \\): Alice can remove 1 token (leaving 10), a winning position for Bob. Thus, \\( W(11) \\).\n- For \\( n = 12 \\): Alice can remove 4 tokens (leaving 8), a winning position for Bob. Thus, \\( W(12) \\).\n- For \\( n = 13 \\): Alice can remove 1 token (leaving 12), a winning position for Bob. Thus, \\( L(13) \\).\n\nContinuing this process, we establish the pattern of winning and losing positions. It appears that the losing positions occur at intervals of 5:\n\n- The losing positions identified thus far are \\( n = 0, 5, 9, 13, 14 \\).\n\nWe can conjecture that losing positions occur at \\( n = 5k \\) for non-negative integers \\( k \\).\n\nTo find how many positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 are losing positions:\n1. We find the largest \\( k \\) such that \\( 5k \\leq 2024 \\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404.\n   \\]\n2. The corresponding losing positions are \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\) (5 multiplied by integers from 1 to 404).\n\nThus, the count of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \\( 404 \\).\n\nFinally, we write the answer in the required format:\n\\[\n\\boxed{404}\n\\]\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n404\n\n# The ground truth problem answer:\n\n809\n\n# Number of LLM calls used: 4\n# Primitives used: estimate_difficulty, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify\n\n# Efficiency Metrics:\n# Average LLM calls: 3.82\n# Lambda: 0.0000\n# Efficiency penalty: 0.0000\n# Combined score: -100.0000 (scale: baseline)\n\n# Primitive Usage:\n#   estimate_difficulty: 90\n#   ensemble_vote: 2220\n#   deep_think: 480\n#   verify: 478\n",
