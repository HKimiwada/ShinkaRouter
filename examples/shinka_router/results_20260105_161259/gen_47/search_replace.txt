refine_routing_and_add_verification
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
This edit proposes a more nuanced routing logic by defining specific solving methods based on problem difficulty and introducing a verification step for validating answers. The strategy involves:
1. Using `quick_solve` for easy problems.
2. Using `ensemble_vote` for medium problems to gather diverse responses.
3. Utilizing `deep_think` followed by `verify` for hard problems to ensure careful analysis and accuracy.
4. Implementing a verification step for all problems to enhance the reliability of responses.
By following this approach, the agent's overall accuracy is likely to improve while maintaining an efficient call structure.

This modification aims to enhance routing logic by effectively utilizing different methods based on the complexity of the problem and ensuring the accuracy of responses through verification.
