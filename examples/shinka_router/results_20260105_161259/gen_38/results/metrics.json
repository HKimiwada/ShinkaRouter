The sum of the items in the list is \\(30\\).\n2. The unique mode of the list is \\(9\\).\n3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.\n\nLet's denote the list as \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\) where \\(n\\) is the number of items in the list. \n\n### Step 1: Mode Condition\nSince the unique mode is \\(9\\), it must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. Let's denote the number of times \\(9\\) appears as \\(k\\). For \\(9\\) to be the unique mode, \\(k\\) must be greater than the frequency of any other number.\n\n### Step 2: Median Condition\nThe median is the middle value when the list is sorted. If \\(n\\) is odd, the median is \\(a_{(n+1)/2}\\). If \\(n\\) is even, the median is the average of \\(a_{n/2}\\) and \\(a_{(n/2)+1}\\). The median must be a positive integer that does not appear in the list.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the List\nLet's start with \\(k = 4\\) (i.e., \\(9\\) appears 4 times). This gives us:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 9 = 36\n\\]\n\nThis exceeds \\(30\\), so we try \\(k = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n3 \\times 9 = 27\n\\]\n\nThis leaves us with \\(30 - 27 = 3\\) to be distributed among the remaining items. The remaining items must be positive integers, and since \\(9\\) is the mode, we can only have one other number that is less than \\(9\\) to ensure \\(9\\) remains the mode.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\(3\\) as the remaining number. Thus, our list is:\n\n\\[\n9, 9, 9, 3\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Check Conditions\n- **Sum**: \\(9 + 9 + 9 + 3 = 30\\) (satisfied)\n- **Mode**: The mode is \\(9\\) (satisfied)\n- **Median**: The sorted list is \\(3, 9, 9, 9\\). The median is \\(\\frac{9 + 9}{2} = 9\\), which does not satisfy the condition that the median must not appear in the list.\n\nNext, let\u2019s try \\(k = 5\\):\n\nIf \\(9\\) appears \\(5\\) times, we have:\n\n\\[\n5 \\times 9 = 45\n\\]\n\nThis exceeds \\(30\\) again. \n\nLet\u2019s try \\(k = 2\\):\n\n\\[\n2 \\times 9 = 18\n\\]\n\nThis leaves us with \\(30 - 18 = 12\\). We can try \\(12\\) as the remaining number. Thus, our list is:\n\n\\[\n9, 9, 12\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Check Conditions Again\n- **Sum**: \\(9 + 9 + 12 = 30\\) (satisfied)\n- **Mode**: The mode is \\(9\\) (satisfied)\n- **Median**: The sorted list is \\(9, 9, 12\\). The median is \\(9\\), which does not satisfy the condition.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\(k = 3\\) again but with different numbers. \n\nLet\u2019s try \\(9, 9, 9, 1, 2\\):\n\n\\[\n9 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 30\n\\]\n\n- **Mode**: The mode is \\(9\\) (satisfied)\n- **Median**: The sorted list is \\(1, 2, 9, 9, 9\\). The median is \\(9\\), which does not satisfy the condition.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\(9, 9, 9, 1, 1\\):\n\n\\[\n9 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 29\n\\]\n\nThis does not work.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\(9, 9, 9, 2, 1\\):\n\n\\[\n9 + 9 + 9 + 2 + 1 = 30\n\\]\n\n- **Mode**: The mode is \\(9\\) (satisfied)\n- **Median**: The sorted list is \\(1, 2, 9, 9, 9\\). The median is \\(9\\), which does not satisfy the condition.\n\nAfter several trials, we can find a valid list:\n\nLet\u2019s try \\(9, 9, 9, 1, 2\\):\n\n\\[\n9 + 9 + 9 + 1 + 2 = 30\n\\]\n\n- **Mode**: The mode is \\(9\\) (satisfied)\n- **Median**: The sorted list is \\(1, 2, 9, 9, 9\\).
