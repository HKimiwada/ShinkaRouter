    "text_feedback": "# Example of an AIME problem that could not be answered correctly:\n\nLet ABCDEF be a convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Find the side length of the hexagon.\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nLet the side length of the hexagon \\( ABCDEF \\) be denoted by \\( s \\). Given that the hexagon is convex, equilateral, and has all pairs of opposite sides parallel, we can deduce that the sides opposite each other are equal in length, namely:\n\n- \\( AB = CD = EF = s \\)\n- \\( BC = DE = FA = s \\)\n\nThe triangle formed by the extensions of segments \\( AB \\), \\( CD \\), and \\( EF \\) has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We denote these side lengths as \\( a = 200 \\), \\( b = 240 \\), and \\( c = 300 \\).\n\nBy the properties of the hexagon, we can relate the sides of the triangle to the sides of the hexagon. The sides of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the hexagon's side length \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\na = s + s \\cdot k_1\n\\]\n\\[\nb = s + s \\cdot k_2\n\\]\n\\[\nc = s + s \\cdot k_3\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( k_1, k_2, k_3 \\) are some coefficients that depend on the angles and arrangement of the hexagon. However, we also know from geometry that the triangle inequality must hold for the triangle formed by \\( a, b, c \\):\n\n1. \\( a + b > c \\)\n2. \\( a + c > b \\)\n3. \\( b + c > a \\)\n\nNow we can check these inequalities:\n\n1. \\( 200 + 240 = 440 > 300 \\) (True)\n2. \\( 200 + 300 = 500 > 240 \\) (True)\n3. \\( 240 + 300 = 540 > 200 \\) (True)\n\nThus, the sides can indeed form a triangle.\n\nNext, we can apply the Law of Cosines to relate the sides \\( a, b, c \\) to the angles and find \\( s \\). However, a simpler approach is to use the area of the triangle. The area \\( K \\) of a triangle with sides \\( a, b, c \\) can be calculated using Heron's formula. \n\nFirst, we compute the semi-perimeter \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{200 + 240 + 300}{2} = 370\n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the area \\( K \\):\n\n\\[\nK = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{370(370-200)(370-240)(370-300)}\n\\]\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{370 \\cdot 170 \\cdot 130 \\cdot 70}\n\\]\n\nThis will yield the area of the triangle. We can simplify this product for easier calculations.\n\nHowever, to find \\( s \\) directly, we can also use the fact that the area for a hexagon can also be expressed in terms of its side length, leading us to the conclusion that the relationships between the sides of the triangle and the hexagon must yield a specific relation.\n\nFrom the relationship of the triangle's area being proportional to the square of its sides, we can correlate:\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{a + b + c}{3} = \\frac{200 + 240 + 300}{3} = \\frac{740}{3} \\approx 246.67\n\\]\n\nThis number rounds to the nearest integer, providing a potential side length.\n\nBy examining the relationships and properties of the triangle and hexagon, we find that:\n\n\\[\ns = 240\n\\]\n\nThis leads us to the final answer. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n240\n\n# The ground truth problem answer:\n\n80\n\n# Number of LLM calls used: 2\n# Primitives used: estimate_difficulty, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, deep_think, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, deep_think, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, deep_think, deep_think, quick_solve, deep_think, deep_think, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve, quick_solve\n\n# Efficiency Metrics:\n# Average LLM calls: 2.00\n# Lambda: 0.0000\n# Efficiency penalty: 0.0000\n# Combined score: -100.0000 (scale: baseline)\n\n# Primitive Usage:\n#   estimate_difficulty: 90\n#   quick_solve: 2220\n#   deep_think: 480\n",
