    "text_feedback": "# Example of an AIME problem that could not be answered correctly:\n\nEach vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the probability that all blue vertices of a regular octagon can be rotated to the positions of the red vertices.\n\nLet \\( n = 8 \\) be the number of vertices in the octagon. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue with equal probability, so there are \\( 2^8 = 256 \\) total colorings.\n\nWe want to find the colorings such that all blue vertices can be rotated to the positions of the red vertices. This means that the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, and the blue vertices must form a configuration that can be rotated to match the red vertices.\n\nLet \\( k \\) be the number of blue vertices. The number of red vertices will then be \\( 8 - k \\). For the blue vertices to be able to occupy the positions of the red vertices after some rotation, \\( k \\) must be a divisor of \\( 8 \\) (the total number of vertices). The divisors of \\( 8 \\) are \\( 1, 2, 4, 8 \\).\n\nWe will analyze each case for \\( k \\):\n\n1. **\\( k = 0 \\)**: All vertices are red. There is \\( 1 \\) way to color the octagon.\n2. **\\( k = 1 \\)**: There are \\( 8 \\) ways to choose \\( 1 \\) blue vertex. This configuration can be rotated to match any of the red vertices.\n3. **\\( k = 2 \\)**: The blue vertices must be in pairs that are opposite each other. There are \\( 4 \\) ways to choose \\( 2 \\) opposite vertices.\n4. **\\( k = 3 \\)**: Not possible, as \\( 3 \\) is not a divisor of \\( 8 \\).\n5. **\\( k = 4 \\)**: The blue vertices must be in pairs that are opposite each other. There are \\( 2 \\) ways to choose \\( 4 \\) vertices (two pairs of opposite vertices).\n6. **\\( k = 5 \\)**: Not possible, as \\( 5 \\) is not a divisor of \\( 8 \\).\n7. **\\( k = 6 \\)**: The blue vertices must be in pairs that are opposite each other. There are \\( 4 \\) ways to choose \\( 2 \\) red vertices (the remaining \\( 6 \\) will be blue).\n8. **\\( k = 7 \\)**: There are \\( 8 \\) ways to choose \\( 1 \\) red vertex. This configuration can be rotated to match any of the blue vertices.\n9. **\\( k = 8 \\)**: All vertices are blue. There is \\( 1 \\) way to color the octagon.\n\nNow, we can summarize the valid configurations:\n- \\( k = 0 \\): \\( 1 \\)\n- \\( k = 1 \\): \\( 8 \\)\n- \\( k = 2 \\): \\( 4 \\)\n- \\( k = 4 \\): \\( 2 \\)\n- \\( k = 6 \\): \\( 4 \\)\n- \\( k = 7 \\): \\( 8 \\)\n- \\( k = 8 \\): \\( 1 \\)\n\nNow we sum these valid configurations:\n\\[\n1 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 1 = 28\n\\]\n\nThus, there are \\( 28 \\) valid colorings where the blue vertices can be rotated to match the red vertices.\n\nThe total number of colorings is \\( 256 \\). Therefore, the probability \\( P \\) that the octagon can be rotated such that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is:\n\\[\nP = \\frac{28}{256} = \\frac{7}{64}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( m = 7 \\) and \\( n = 64 \\) are relatively prime. Thus, \\( m+n = 7 + 64 = 71 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{71}\n\\]\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n71\n\n# The ground truth problem answer:\n\n371\n\n# Number of LLM calls used: 3\n# Primitives used: estimate_difficulty, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify\n\n# Efficiency Metrics:\n# Average LLM calls: 2.94\n# Lambda: 0.0000\n# Efficiency penalty: 0.0000\n# Combined score: -100.0000 (scale: baseline)\n\n# Primitive Usage:\n#   estimate_difficulty: 90\n#   deep_think: 2700\n#   verify: 2393\n",
