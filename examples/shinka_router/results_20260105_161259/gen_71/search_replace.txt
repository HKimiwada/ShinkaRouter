improve_routing_decision
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
Enhance the `forward` method by introducing more effective routing strategies based on the problem's difficulty. The new logic will:
- Use `baseline_solve` for easy problems.
- Implement `ensemble_vote` for medium-difficulty problems, allowing for multiple perspectives and improved accuracy.
- Combine `deep_think` and `verify` for hard problems to ensure thorough reasoning and validation of the solutions presented.
This improvement aims to balance accuracy and resource efficiency.
