    "text_feedback": "# Example of an AIME problem that could not be answered correctly:\n\nAlice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to \\( 2024 \\) for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the winning and losing positions in the game.\n\n1. **Winning and Losing Positions**:\n   - A position is a winning position for the player whose turn it is if they can force a win regardless of the opponent's moves.\n   - A position is a losing position if every possible move leaves the opponent in a winning position.\n\n2. **Base Cases**:\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\): Alice can take 1 token and win. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 2 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\): Alice can take all 4 tokens and win. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 4 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 6 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 5 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 7 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 6 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 8 \\): Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 4 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 9 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 8 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 10 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 9 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 11 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 10 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 12 \\): Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 8 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 13 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 12 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 14 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 13 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 15 \\): Alice can take 1 token, leaving 14 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n   - For \\( n = 16 \\): Alice can take 4 tokens, leaving 12 for Bob, who then wins. (Winning for Alice)\n\n3. **Identifying Losing Positions**:\n   - A losing position occurs when the player cannot make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position.\n   - From the above analysis, we can see that positions \\( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 \\) are winning for Alice.\n   - Continuing this pattern, we find that every 5th position starting from \\( n = 0 \\) (i.e., \\( n = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, \\ldots \\)) is a losing position for Alice.\n\n4. **Generalizing the Pattern**:\n   - The losing positions for Alice are \\( n \\equiv 0 \\mod 5 \\).\n   - Therefore, Bob has a winning strategy when \\( n \\) is of the form \\( 5k \\) for \\( k \\geq 1 \\).\n\n5. **Counting the Valid \\( n \\)**:\n   - We need to count the multiples of \\( 5 \\) that are less than or equal to \\( 2024 \\).\n   - The largest multiple of \\( 5 \\) less than or equal to \\( 2024 \\) is \\( 2020 \\).\n   - The multiples of \\( 5 \\) are \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\).\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence where \\( a = 5 \\), \\( d = 5 \\), and the last term \\( l = 2020 \\).\n   - The number of terms \\( n \\) in this sequence can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{l - a}{d} + 1 = \\frac{2020 - 5}{5} + 1 = \\frac{2015}{5} + 1 = 403 + 1 = 404.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to \\( 2024 \\) for which Bob has a winning strategy is \\( 404 \\).\n\nThe proposed answer of \\( 674 \\) is incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{404}\\).\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n404\n\n# The ground truth problem answer:\n\n809\n\n# Number of LLM calls used: 3\n# Primitives used: estimate_difficulty, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, ensemble_vote, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, ensemble_vote, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify\n\n# Efficiency Metrics:\n# Average LLM calls: 3.11\n# Lambda: 0.0000\n# Efficiency penalty: 0.0000\n# Combined score: -100.0000 (scale: baseline)\n\n# Primitive Usage:\n#   estimate_difficulty: 90\n#   deep_think: 2280\n#   ensemble_vote: 420\n#   verify: 1977\n",
