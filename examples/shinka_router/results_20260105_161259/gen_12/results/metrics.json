    "text_feedback": "# Example of an AIME problem that could not be answered correctly:\n\nEight circles of radius $34$ are sequentially tangent, and two of the circles are tangent to $AB$ and $BC$ of triangle $ABC$, respectively. $2024$ circles of radius $1$ can be arranged in the same manner. The inradius of triangle $ABC$ can be expressed as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to analyze the arrangement of the circles and how they relate to the triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n1. **Understanding the arrangement of circles**: We have eight circles of radius \\( 34 \\) that are sequentially tangent. The arrangement suggests that these circles are placed in a way that they form a pattern, likely around the triangle \\( ABC \\).\n\n2. **Finding the inradius**: The inradius \\( r \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\) can be related to the radius of the circles. The circles are tangent to the sides of the triangle, and the inradius can be derived from the configuration of these circles.\n\n3. **Using the given information**: The problem states that \\( 2024 \\) circles of radius \\( 1 \\) can be arranged in the same manner. This suggests a scaling relationship between the radius of the circles and the inradius of the triangle.\n\n4. **Calculating the inradius**: The inradius \\( r \\) can be calculated using the formula for the inradius in terms of the radius of the circles. If we denote the radius of the larger circles as \\( R = 34 \\) and the smaller circles as \\( r = 1 \\), we can set up a ratio based on the number of circles.\n\n   The number of circles is proportional to the inradius, so we can set up the following relationship:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{R}{r} = \\frac{34}{1} = 34\n   \\]\n   This means that the inradius \\( r \\) of triangle \\( ABC \\) can be expressed in terms of the radius of the larger circles.\n\n5. **Finding the inradius in simplest form**: The inradius \\( r \\) can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{34 \\cdot 1}{34 + 1} = \\frac{34}{35}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( m = 34 \\) and \\( n = 35 \\) are relatively prime.\n\n6. **Calculating \\( m+n \\)**: We find:\n   \\[\n   m+n = 34 + 35 = 69\n   \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\( \\boxed{69} \\).\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n69\n\n# The ground truth problem answer:\n\n197\n\n# Number of LLM calls used: 3\n# Primitives used: estimate_difficulty, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, deep_think, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify, verify\n\n# Efficiency Metrics:\n# Average LLM calls: 2.94\n# Lambda: 0.0000\n# Efficiency penalty: 0.0000\n# Combined score: -100.0000 (scale: baseline)\n\n# Primitive Usage:\n#   estimate_difficulty: 90\n#   deep_think: 2700\n#   verify: 2405\n",
