difficulty_based_routing
</NAME>

<DESCRIPTION>
This modification introduces a difficulty-based routing strategy. By estimating the difficulty of the problem first, we can route easy problems to the `baseline_solve` method and harder problems to a combination of `deep_think` and `verify`. This approach helps ensure that we utilize the most suitable methods for the problem's complexity, which should improve accuracy while keeping the average number of calls low.
