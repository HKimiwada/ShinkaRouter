<DESCRIPTION>
The current routing logic relies heavily on `deep_think` for medium and hard problems, which can lead to excessive LLM calls without guaranteeing accuracy. I propose a modification to include a fallback mechanism that utilizes `quick_solve` for easy problems and `ensemble_vote` for medium problems. This would reduce the number of calls while still allowing for verification of answers, thus improving the overall accuracy and efficiency of the agent.
