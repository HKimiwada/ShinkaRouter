Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.

The center of the circle is at \\( (0, 0) \\) and the axis of revolution is at \\( (6, 0) \\).\n   - The distance from the center of the torus to the center of the sphere \\( S \\) (which has a radius of \\( 11 \\)) is \\( 6 + 3 = 9 \\) when the torus is resting on the outside of the sphere.\n\n2. **Finding the Radii**:\n   - The radius \\( r_i \\) corresponds to the case when the torus is in a position where it is externally tangent to the sphere. The center of the sphere is at \\( (0,0) \\) and the center of the torus is at \\( (6, 0) \\). The distance from the center of the sphere to the circle of tangency is \\( R_S - R_T = 11 - 3 = 8 \\).\n   - Thus, when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere, we can calculate:\n     \\[\n     r_i = \\sqrt{(6)^2 - (8)^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 64} = \\sqrt{0} = 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculating \\( r_o \\)**:\n   - The radius \\( r_o \\) corresponds to the case when the torus is still external but at the farthest point from the sphere. Here, the distance is \\( R_S + R_T = 11 + 3 = 14 \\).\n   - The circle of tangency radius can be calculated as:\n     \\[\n     r_o = \\sqrt{(6)^2 - (14)^2} = \\sqrt{36 - 196} = \\sqrt{-160} = 0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Difference**:\n   - Now, we compute the difference:\n     \\[\n     r_i - r_o = 0 - 0 = 0\n     \\]\n   - However, since we need the absolute difference, we reassess:\n     \\[\n     r_i \\text{ should be } 8 \\text{ and } r_o \\text{ should be } 14 \\text{ (in proper tangents)}\n     \\]\n   - Thus:\n     \\[\n     r_i = 8, \\quad r_o = 14.\n     \\]\n   - The final difference is:\n     \\[\n     r_i - r_o = 8 - 14 = -6\n     \\]\n\n5. **Expressing as \\( \\frac{m}{n} \\)**:\n   - The difference can be expressed as \\( \\frac{-6}{1} \\). Here, \\( m = 6 \\) and \\( n = 1 \\) which are relatively prime.\n\n6. **Final Calculation**:\n   - Thus, we find \\( m+n = 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n7\n\n# The ground truth problem answer:\n\n127\n\n# Number of LLM calls used: 4\n\n# Efficiency Metrics:\n# Average LLM calls: 4.00\n# Lambda: 0.0000\n# Efficiency penalty: 0.0000\n# Combined score: -100.0000 (scale: baseline)\n\n# Primitive Usage:\n",
