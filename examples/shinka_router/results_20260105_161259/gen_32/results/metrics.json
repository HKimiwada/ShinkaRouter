    "text_feedback": "# Example of an AIME problem that could not be answered correctly:\n\nThere is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that: \n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nTo find the number of ways to place the chips in the \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid under the given conditions, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understanding the Placement Rules**:\n   - Each row and each column can contain chips of only one color.\n   - There can be no more than one chip in each cell.\n   - The maximum number of chips in the grid is 25, but we can have fewer than that.\n\n2. **Choosing Rows and Columns**:\n   - We will first decide how many rows will have black chips and how many will have white chips.\n   - Let \\(r\\) be the number of rows that will have black chips and \\(5 - r\\) be the number of rows that will have white chips.\n   - Similarly, let \\(c\\) be the number of columns that will have black chips and \\(5 - c\\) be the number of columns that will have white chips.\n\n3. **Ensuring a Valid Configuration**:\n   - To ensure that the configuration is valid, the total number of chips placed in the grid must not exceed the total number of available chips for each color.\n   - The number of black chips used will be \\(r \\times c\\) (black rows times black columns), and the number of white chips will be \\((5 - r) \\times (5 - c)\\).\n\n4. **Counting the Configurations**:\n   - For each possible pair \\((r, c)\\), we need to count how many ways we can choose which \\(r\\) rows will contain black chips and which \\(c\\) columns will contain black chips.\n\n5. **Iterating Over Possible Values**:\n   - The values of \\(r\\) and \\(c\\) can range from \\(0\\) to \\(5\\).\n   - For each \\(r\\) and \\(c\\), we can count:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{5}{r} \\cdot \\binom{5}{c}\n     \\]\n   - We then need to ensure that the chips do not exceed the available chips. This is satisfied as we are using at most 25 chips in total.\n\n6. **Calculating Total Ways**:\n   - The total number of configurations can be calculated by summing over all possible values of \\(r\\) and \\(c\\):\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Ways} = \\sum_{r=0}^{5} \\sum_{c=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{r} \\cdot \\binom{5}{c}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Simplifying the Sum**:\n   - Notice that:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{r=0}^{5} \\binom{5}{r} = 2^5 = 32\n   \\]\n   - Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Ways} = 32 \\cdot 32 = 1024\n   \\]\n\n8. **Final Output**:\n   - The total number of ways to place the chips in the grid, under the given conditions, is 1024. Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1024}\n\\]\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n1024\n\n# The ground truth problem answer:\n\n902\n\n# Number of LLM calls used: 4\n\n# Efficiency Metrics:\n# Average LLM calls: 4.00\n# Lambda: 0.0000\n# Efficiency penalty: 0.0000\n# Combined score: -100.0000 (scale: baseline)\n\n# Primitive Usage:\n",
