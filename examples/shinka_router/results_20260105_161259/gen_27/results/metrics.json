    "text_feedback": "# Example of an AIME problem that could not be answered correctly:\n\nRectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are drawn such that $D,E,C,F$ are collinear. Also, $A,D,H,G$ all lie on a circle. If $BC=16$,$AB=107$,$FG=17$, and $EF=184$, what is the length of $CE$?\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to analyze the given information about the rectangles and the relationships between their sides.\n\n1. **Understanding the rectangles**:\n   - Rectangle \\(ABCD\\) has sides \\(AB = 107\\) and \\(BC = 16\\).\n   - Rectangle \\(EFGH\\) has sides \\(EF = 184\\) and \\(FG = 17\\).\n\n2. **Collinearity**:\n   - Points \\(D, E, C, F\\) are collinear. This means that the points lie on a straight line.\n\n3. **Circle condition**:\n   - Points \\(A, D, H, G\\) lie on a circle. This implies that the angles subtended by these points at the circumference are equal.\n\n4. **Finding the length of \\(CE\\)**:\n   - Since \\(D, E, C, F\\) are collinear, we can express the lengths in terms of the coordinates of the points.\n   - Let\u2019s place the rectangles in a coordinate system for clarity:\n     - Let \\(D\\) be at the origin \\((0, 0)\\).\n     - Then \\(C\\) would be at \\((0, 16)\\) (since \\(BC = 16\\)).\n     - \\(A\\) would be at \\((-107, 0)\\) (since \\(AB = 107\\)).\n     - \\(B\\) would be at \\((-107, 16)\\).\n     - For rectangle \\(EFGH\\), since \\(E\\) is collinear with \\(D\\) and \\(C\\), we can place \\(E\\) at some point along the line extending from \\(D\\) through \\(C\\).\n\n5. **Using the dimensions of rectangle \\(EFGH\\)**:\n   - Since \\(EF = 184\\) and \\(FG = 17\\), we can place \\(E\\) at \\((x, 0)\\) where \\(x\\) is to be determined.\n   - The length \\(CE\\) can be expressed as the distance from point \\(C\\) to point \\(E\\).\n\n6. **Calculating \\(CE\\)**:\n   - The coordinates of \\(C\\) are \\((0, 16)\\) and the coordinates of \\(E\\) are \\((x, 0)\\).\n   - The distance \\(CE\\) can be calculated using the distance formula:\n     \\[\n     CE = \\sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - 16)^2} = \\sqrt{x^2 + 256}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Finding \\(x\\)**:\n   - Since \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are collinear with \\(C\\) and \\(F\\), we can find \\(x\\) based on the dimensions of rectangle \\(EFGH\\).\n   - The total length from \\(D\\) to \\(F\\) must equal \\(EF + FG\\) which is \\(184 + 17 = 201\\).\n   - Since \\(D\\) is at \\(0\\) and \\(C\\) is at \\(16\\), we can find \\(E\\) such that \\(E\\) is at \\(x = 201 - 16 = 185\\).\n\n8. **Calculating \\(CE\\) with \\(x = 185\\)**:\n   - Now substituting \\(x = 185\\) into the distance formula:\n     \\[\n     CE = \\sqrt{185^2 + 256} = \\sqrt{34225 + 256} = \\sqrt{34481}\n     \\]\n   - Calculating \\(CE\\):\n     \\[\n     CE = 185.5 \\text{ (approximately)}\n     \\]\n\nSince the proposed answer was \\(0\\), which is incorrect, the correct answer is the calculated distance \\(CE\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{185}\n\\]\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n185\n\n# The ground truth problem answer:\n\n104\n\n# Number of LLM calls used: 3\n# Primitives used: estimate_difficulty, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, deep_think, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, ensemble_vote, verify, verify, verify, verify\n\n# Efficiency Metrics:\n# Average LLM calls: 3.84\n# Lambda: 0.0000\n# Efficiency penalty: 0.0000\n# Combined score: -100.0000 (scale: baseline)\n\n# Primitive Usage:\n#   estimate_difficulty: 90\n#   ensemble_vote: 2280\n#   deep_think: 420\n#   verify: 417\n",
