# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- The current best program, **ShinkaRouter**, demonstrates that **simplicity and stability in primitive usage**—primarily relying on a minimal set of well-defined primitives like `baseline_solve`, `deep_think`, `verify`, and `ensemble_vote`—correlate strongly with higher correctness and validation success, achieving a **score of +32.22**.
- **Consistent prompt structures** across primitives, especially in `verify()` and `deep_think()`, facilitate more reliable answer extraction, which directly improves answer accuracy and validation outcomes.
- The **explicit primitive call tracking and reset mechanisms** enable the routing logic to make informed primitive selections, reducing unnecessary calls and minimizing error propagation, contributing to the program’s efficiency and correctness.
- The **layered routing strategy**—using difficulty estimation to guide primitive choice, combined with verification and iterative refinement—embodies a balanced approach that maximizes correctness while controlling primitive call counts, as evidenced by the average of **3.13 LLM calls per problem**.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Programs such as **Generation 0** and **Generation 4**, which relied heavily on **complex primitive chaining** involving `deep_think`, `ensemble_vote`, and `self_critique`, consistently scored **-100**, indicating that **overly intricate, multi-layered primitive sequences** introduce noise and reduce accuracy.
- Approaches with **unreliable difficulty estimation** (e.g., **hierarchical_difficulty_routing**, **multi_stage_routing_strategy**) failed to improve correctness, often leading to poor routing decisions and lower scores.
- The **high primitive call counts** (average 3-5 calls per problem) in many approaches did not translate into better accuracy, suggesting that **excessive primitive usage and fallback strategies** can cause compounded errors, especially when primitive responses are inconsistent or answer extraction is unreliable.
- Approaches lacking **answer verification or iterative refinement** (e.g., **simple_dedicated_router**, **simple_vs_detailed_routing**) performed poorly, with scores of 0 or negative, emphasizing the importance of verification steps for correctness.

## Implementation Insights
- The **current best program’s effectiveness** stems from **minimalist, stable primitive calls**—primarily `baseline_solve` and `deep_think`—which are used judiciously based on difficulty estimates, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- The **consistent prompt formatting** across primitives, especially in `verify()` and `deep_think()`, enhances answer extraction reliability, which is crucial for validation and voting mechanisms.
- The **primitive call tracking and resetting** mechanisms support more precise routing decisions, reducing redundant or unhelpful primitive calls, thereby improving efficiency and correctness.
- The **answer extraction method** (`extract_boxed_answer`) is straightforward and robust, enabling accurate majority voting and verification, which correlates with higher validation success.
- The **balanced primitive usage**—limiting the number of calls per problem—avoids overfitting to noisy or inconsistent primitive responses, leading to more reliable solutions.

## Performance Analysis
- The **current best program** achieved a **score of +32.22**, with an accuracy of **32.22%** and an average of **3.13 LLM calls per problem**, indicating that **targeted, stable primitive strategies** outperform more complex, multi-primitive fallback approaches.
- Other programs, such as **Generation 12** and **Generation 13**, with similar primitive sets but more elaborate routing, scored **-100**, demonstrating that **increased complexity and primitive chaining do not necessarily improve correctness**.
- Approaches with **overly complex routing strategies** (e.g., **hierarchical_difficulty_routing**, **simple_vs_detailed_routing**) failed to pass validation, often due to unreliable difficulty classification and primitive responses.
- The pattern suggests that **simplicity, consistency, and explicit verification**—as exemplified by **ShinkaRouter**—are key to achieving higher scores, whereas **overly intricate primitive chaining** correlates with poor performance.

---

**In summary**, the evaluation confirms that **a minimalist, stable primitive approach with consistent prompt structures and explicit answer extraction** is most effective. The **current best program** exemplifies this pattern, achieving correctness and validation success with a straightforward, well-engineered design. Conversely, **overly complex routing, excessive primitive chaining, and unreliable difficulty estimation** tend to degrade performance, as evidenced by the negative scores of other approaches.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. **Implement a difficulty-based routing strategy that explicitly classifies problems into 'easy', 'medium', and 'hard' categories using the existing `estimate_difficulty()` primitive, then tailor primitive sequences accordingly.** For 'easy' problems, prioritize `baseline_solve` with minimal verification; for 'medium', combine `deep_think` with `ensemble_vote`; and for 'hard', incorporate `self_critique` and multiple `deep_think` iterations. This approach leverages the current best program’s success in balancing primitive usage and correctness, reducing unnecessary calls on straightforward problems.

2. **Refine answer extraction by enhancing `extract_boxed_answer()` to handle nested or multi-line responses more robustly, possibly by integrating pattern matching for multiple answer formats.** Since answer extraction directly impacts verification and voting accuracy, a more sophisticated parser can improve answer reliability, leading to higher validation success and overall correctness, as demonstrated by the current program’s effective answer extraction.

3. **Introduce a primitive that classifies problem types (e.g., `classify_problem_type()`) and use this classification to invoke specialized reasoning primitives or prompts tailored to algebra, geometry, or number theory.** This targeted routing can improve reasoning accuracy for domain-specific problems, reducing the reliance on generic reasoning and thus increasing correctness, building upon the current program’s modular primitive design.

4. **Incorporate an adaptive ensemble voting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of samples or temperature based on the consensus confidence, such as increasing ensemble size or lowering temperature when answers are ambiguous.** This adaptive approach can improve answer stability and correctness, especially for problems with high answer variability, aligning with the current program’s effective ensemble strategy and primitive diversity.

5. **Limit the total number of primitive calls per problem by establishing a threshold (e.g., 3-4 calls) and trigger iterative `self_critique()` or `deep_think()` only when verification indicates potential errors.** This conservative primitive usage minimizes error propagation and reduces unnecessary calls, further improving efficiency and correctness, as evidenced by the current program’s balanced primitive utilization and success in passing validation.
