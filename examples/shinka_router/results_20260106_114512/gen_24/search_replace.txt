replace_forward_in_editable_block
</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Since the code is within an immutable region, I will now replace the entire content of the `forward` method directly within the specified editable region (lines 395-411). This ensures the new logic for difficulty estimation and routing is correctly inserted without relying on pattern matching. The code will implement the adaptive routing based on estimated difficulty.
