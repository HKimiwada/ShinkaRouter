adaptive_difficulty_routing
</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Implement a more nuanced routing strategy based on problem difficulty estimation. Instead of a fixed approach for each difficulty level, dynamically select primitives that balance accuracy and call efficiency. For example, for "medium" problems, use a single deep_think + verify sequence, but for "hard" problems, consider ensemble_vote + verify, and for "easy" problems, rely solely on baseline_solve. This adaptive approach leverages the difficulty estimate to optimize primitive usage, potentially improving accuracy while controlling calls, aligning with the goal of maximizing the combined score.
