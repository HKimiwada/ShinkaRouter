<DESCRIPTION>
Implement an adaptive branching strategy in the forward() function based on problem difficulty estimation. By classifying problems as 'easy', 'medium', or 'hard' through estimate_difficulty(), the agent can allocate resources more effectively: solving easy problems directly with baseline_solve, tackling medium ones with deep_think plus verification, and deploying ensemble_vote plus verification for the hardest problems. This targeted approach aims to improve accuracy on challenging problems while conserving calls on simpler ones, thus enhancing the overall combined score.
