routing_with_difficulty_estimate
</NAME>
<DESCRIPTION>
Modify the forward() method within the specified editable region to incorporate a problem difficulty estimation step. This allows the agent to select different routing primitives based on the estimated difficulty—using a simple solve for easy problems, and more careful reasoning with verification for harder problems. This targeted approach aims to improve overall accuracy and efficiency.
