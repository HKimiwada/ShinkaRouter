# GLOBAL INSIGHTS SCRATCHPAD

The following are global insights about optimization approaches and their effectiveness:

## Successful Algorithmic Patterns
- The current best program, **ShinkaRouter**, exemplifies that **simplicity and stability in primitive usage**—primarily relying on `baseline_solve`, `deep_think`, `verify`, and `ensemble_vote`—correlate strongly with higher correctness, achieving a **score of +32.22**. Its minimalist approach avoids over-chaining primitives, reducing noise and error propagation.
- **Consistent prompt structures** across primitives, especially in `verify()` and `deep_think()`, facilitate more reliable answer extraction, which directly improves answer accuracy and validation success.
- The **primitive call tracking and reset mechanisms** support more precise routing decisions, minimizing unnecessary calls and focusing on effective reasoning strategies.
- The **layered routing strategy**—using difficulty estimation to guide primitive choice, combined with verification and iterative refinement—embodies a balanced approach that maximizes correctness while maintaining efficiency, with an average of **3.13 LLM calls per problem**.
- The **use of moderate temperature in ensemble_vote (0.5)** and consistent prompt formatting contribute to more accurate majority voting, as seen in the high correctness of the best program.

## Ineffective Approaches
- Programs such as **Generation 0** and **Generation 4**, which relied heavily on **complex primitive chaining** involving `deep_think`, `ensemble_vote`, and `self_critique`, consistently scored **-100**, indicating that **overly intricate, multi-layered primitive sequences** introduce noise and reduce accuracy.
- Approaches with **unreliable difficulty estimation** (e.g., **hierarchical_difficulty_routing**, **multi_stage_routing_strategy**) failed to improve correctness, often leading to poor routing decisions and lower scores.
- The **high primitive call counts** (average 3-5 calls per problem) in many approaches did not translate into better accuracy, suggesting that **excessive primitive usage and fallback strategies** can cause compounded errors, especially when primitive responses are inconsistent or answer extraction is unreliable.
- Approaches lacking **answer verification or iterative refinement** (e.g., **simple_dedicated_router**, **simple_vs_detailed_routing**) performed poorly, with scores of 0 or negative, emphasizing the importance of verification steps for correctness.

## Implementation Insights
- The **current best program’s effectiveness** stems from **minimalist, stable primitive calls**—primarily `baseline_solve` and `deep_think`—used judiciously based on difficulty estimates, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
- **Consistent prompt formatting** across primitives, especially in `verify()` and `deep_think()`, enhances answer extraction reliability, which is crucial for validation and voting mechanisms.
- The **primitive call tracking and resetting** mechanisms support more precise routing decisions, reducing redundant or unhelpful primitive calls, thereby improving efficiency and correctness.
- The **answer extraction method** (`extract_boxed_answer`) is straightforward and robust, enabling accurate majority voting and verification, which correlates with higher validation success.
- The **balanced primitive usage**—limiting the number of calls per problem—avoids overfitting to noisy or inconsistent primitive responses, leading to more reliable solutions.

## Performance Analysis
- The **current best program** achieved a **score of +32.22**, with an accuracy of **32.22%** and an average of **3.13 LLM calls per problem**, indicating that **targeted, stable primitive strategies** outperform more complex, multi-primitive fallback approaches.
- Other programs, such as **Generation 12** and **Generation 13**, with similar primitive sets but more elaborate routing, scored **-100**, demonstrating that **increased complexity and primitive chaining do not necessarily improve correctness**.
- Approaches with **overly complex routing strategies** (e.g., **hierarchical_difficulty_routing**, **simple_vs_detailed_routing**) failed to pass validation, often due to unreliable difficulty classification and primitive responses.
- The pattern suggests that **simplicity, consistency, and explicit verification**—as exemplified by **ShinkaRouter**—are key to achieving higher scores, whereas **overly intricate primitive chaining** correlates with poor performance.

---

**In summary**, the evaluation confirms that **a minimalist, stable primitive approach with consistent prompt structures and explicit answer extraction** is most effective. The **current best program** exemplifies this pattern, achieving correctness and validation success with a straightforward, well-engineered design. Conversely, **overly complex routing, excessive primitive chaining, and unreliable difficulty estimation** tend to degrade performance, as evidenced by the negative scores of other approaches.

# META RECOMMENDATIONS

The following are actionable recommendations for the next program generations:

1. **Implement a problem difficulty classification step using `estimate_difficulty()` to dynamically select a minimal, high-confidence primitive strategy—such as `baseline_solve` for 'easy' problems and `deep_think` with verification for 'medium' and 'hard' problems.** This targeted routing aligns with the best program’s success in balancing primitive calls and correctness, reducing unnecessary complexity on straightforward problems and focusing more intensive reasoning on challenging ones.

2. **Refine the `verify()` primitive to incorporate explicit, multi-step validation prompts that ask the LLM to systematically check each reasoning step and intermediate calculation.** Since the current best program benefits from explicit verification, enhancing this primitive to produce more reliable validation can further improve answer correctness and validation success rates, especially for complex solutions.

3. **Introduce a `problem_type` classification primitive (`classify_problem_type()`) to identify whether a problem is algebra, geometry, or number theory, and then tailor the reasoning approach accordingly—e.g., using geometric reasoning prompts for geometry problems.** Leveraging problem-specific routing can help the agent apply more precise reasoning strategies, potentially increasing accuracy and reducing extraneous primitive calls.

4. **Incorporate a lightweight iterative refinement loop where, after an initial `deep_think()` or `baseline_solve()`, the agent performs a `self_critique()` only if the verification indicates potential errors.** This adaptive approach minimizes unnecessary primitive calls, reduces noise, and aligns with the best program’s pattern of targeted, iterative improvement, thereby boosting overall correctness and efficiency.

5. **Adjust the `ensemble_vote()` to dynamically vary the number of samples based on the confidence level of the initial answers—using answer distribution analysis to determine when additional samples are needed.** This adaptive voting strategy can improve answer stability and correctness, building on the current effective voting mechanism, and potentially increasing the overall accuracy beyond the current best score.
