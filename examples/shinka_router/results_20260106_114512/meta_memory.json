    "1. **Simplify routing to prioritize the baseline_solve primitive**: Given the current best program's success with minimal primitive calls and straightforward routing, focus on evolving the `forward()` method to consistently select `baseline_solve` for most problems. This leverages its proven reliability and reduces complexity, aligning with the insight that minimal, stable primitives outperform multi-primitive chains.\n\n2. **Incorporate a lightweight answer verification step post-solution**: Add a simple `verify()` call immediately after `baseline_solve` to confirm the correctness of the obtained answer. Since the current best program's answer extraction and verification are crucial, this step can help filter out incorrect solutions early, improving overall accuracy without significantly increasing primitive calls.\n\n3. **Implement a primitive call tracking and adaptive fallback mechanism**: Use the primitive call tracking to monitor if `baseline_solve` consistently produces answers, and if not, trigger a fallback to `deep_think()` or `self_critique()` for problematic cases. This targeted fallback approach builds on the current program's stability, allowing selective use of more complex primitives only when necessary, thus balancing simplicity and robustness.\n\n4. **Refine answer extraction to handle more complex or ambiguous responses**: Enhance `extract_boxed_answer()` to better parse varied answer formats, especially in cases where the primitive outputs reasoning or multiple steps.

When such patterns are detected, trigger targeted fallback primitives like `self_critique` or additional `deep_think` attempts, ensuring the program adapts to problem difficulty without overusing complex chains.\n\n3. **Refine answer extraction and verification to handle diverse response formats**: Enhance `extract_boxed_answer()` to parse more complex or multi-step responses reliably, especially in cases where reasoning is included. Coupling this with a robust `verify()` that checks the full response rather than just the answer will improve correctness, as demonstrated by the current best program\u2019s emphasis on consistent prompt formatting.\n\n4. **Reduce primitive call counts by limiting deep_think and ensemble voting to only when necessary**: Since excessive primitive calls correlate with poor performance, design the routing to use `deep_think` or `ensemble_vote` only for problems flagged as difficult or uncertain after initial attempts. This targeted approach conserves resources and minimizes noise, aligning with the success pattern of minimal primitive usage.\n\n5. **Incorporate a lightweight, iterative answer refinement loop**: After obtaining an initial answer via `baseline_solve`, perform a single `self_critique` or `deep_think` to refine the solution if the verification indicates potential errors.

This reduces unnecessary primitive calls and complexity, capitalizing on the proven stability and answer extraction reliability, which correlates with higher accuracy.\n\n2. **Incorporate a dynamic difficulty assessment to selectively invoke `deep_think` or `ensemble_vote` only for problems flagged as difficult**: Use the `estimate_difficulty()` primitive early in the routing to classify problems as easy, medium, or hard. For medium and hard problems, trigger `deep_think` or `ensemble_vote` to improve reasoning, but keep the process minimal for easy problems. This targeted approach aligns with the current best program\u2019s layered routing, optimizing primitive usage and accuracy.\n\n3. **Refine answer extraction and verification to handle multi-step responses more robustly**: Enhance `extract_boxed_answer()` to parse complex, reasoning-including responses reliably, and ensure `verify()` evaluates the full response rather than just the answer. This focus on answer integrity and verification consistency has been a key factor in the best program\u2019s success, reducing errors and improving correctness.\n\n4. **Limit primitive calls by establishing a threshold for primitive usage per problem, and trigger iterative refinement only when verification indicates potential errors**: Set a cap on primitive calls (e.g., 2-3 per problem), and after initial `baseline_solve`, perform a single `self_critique()` or `deep_think()` if verification suggests uncertainty. This approach maintains the simplicity and efficiency demonstrated by the current best, avoiding overuse of primitives that can introduce noise.\n\n5. **Add a specialized primitive for problem-specific reasoning, such as a `category_reasoning()` primitive, to guide routing decisions based on problem type**: Use the `classify_problem_type()` primitive to inform whether to apply geometric, algebraic, or number-theoretic reasoning strategies, and adapt the routing accordingly. This targeted, problem-aware routing leverages the current best program\u2019s modular design, potentially increasing accuracy by applying the most relevant reasoning approach for each problem category.",
    "1. **Prioritize a minimal, answer-focused routing strategy that relies primarily on `baseline_solve` for straightforward problems, followed by a `verify()` step for validation.** This approach leverages the current best program\u2019s success in maintaining answer accuracy with minimal primitive calls, reducing complexity and potential error sources. Implementing early difficulty estimation to decide whether to use `baseline_solve` or more elaborate reasoning can further optimize primitive usage and improve overall correctness.\n\n2. **Incorporate a targeted difficulty classification step using `estimate_difficulty()` before selecting the reasoning strategy.** For easy problems, rely on `baseline_solve`; for medium difficulty, employ `deep_think` with a subsequent `verify()`; and for hard problems, add an iterative `self_critique()` before verification. This adaptive routing aligns with the proven effectiveness of layered, difficulty-dependent strategies, ensuring complex problems receive more reasoning while keeping simple problems efficiently solved.\n\n3. **Enhance answer extraction robustness by refining `extract_boxed_answer()` to handle multi-step responses and reasoning outputs more reliably.** Since answer extraction is critical for majority voting and verification, improving parsing accuracy\u2014such as handling nested boxes or multi-line reasoning\u2014can reduce answer ambiguity and improve verification success. This focus on answer integrity directly supports the current program\u2019s high accuracy and stability.\n\n4. **Limit primitive calls per problem by establishing a maximum threshold (e.g., 2-3 calls), and trigger iterative refinement only when verification indicates potential errors.** This conservative primitive usage prevents overcomplication and error propagation, as demonstrated by the current best program\u2019s efficiency. When verification flags uncertainty, selectively invoke `deep_think()` or `self_critique()` to refine answers, balancing thoroughness with simplicity.\n\n5. **Implement a problem-type classification primitive (`classify_problem_type()`) to guide specialized reasoning pathways.** By categorizing problems into algebra, geometry, or number theory, the routing can invoke tailored primitives or prompts optimized for each category, potentially increasing correctness. This modular, problem-aware approach builds on the current program\u2019s flexible routing and can lead to more precise reasoning and fewer errors in complex problem domains.",

This approach leverages the current best program\u2019s success in balancing primitive usage and correctness, reducing unnecessary calls on straightforward problems.\n\n2. **Refine answer extraction by enhancing `extract_boxed_answer()` to handle nested or multi-line responses more robustly, possibly by integrating pattern matching for multiple answer formats.** Since answer extraction directly impacts verification and voting accuracy, a more sophisticated parser can improve answer reliability, leading to higher validation success and overall correctness, as demonstrated by the current program\u2019s effective answer extraction.\n\n3. **Introduce a primitive that classifies problem types (e.g., `classify_problem_type()`) and use this classification to invoke specialized reasoning primitives or prompts tailored to algebra, geometry, or number theory.** This targeted routing can improve reasoning accuracy for domain-specific problems, reducing the reliance on generic reasoning and thus increasing correctness, building upon the current program\u2019s modular primitive design.\n\n4. **Incorporate an adaptive ensemble voting mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of samples or temperature based on the consensus confidence, such as increasing ensemble size or lowering temperature when answers are ambiguous.** This adaptive approach can improve answer stability and correctness, especially for problems with high answer variability, aligning with the current program\u2019s effective ensemble strategy and primitive diversity.\n\n5. **Limit the total number of primitive calls per problem by establishing a threshold (e.g., 3-4 calls) and trigger iterative `self_critique()` or `deep_think()` only when verification indicates potential errors.** This conservative primitive usage minimizes error propagation and reduces unnecessary calls, further improving efficiency and correctness, as evidenced by the current program\u2019s balanced primitive utilization and success in passing validation.",
