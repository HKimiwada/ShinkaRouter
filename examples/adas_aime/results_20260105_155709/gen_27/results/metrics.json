Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n[asy] unitsize(0.3 inch); draw(ellipse((0,0), 3, 1.75)); draw((-1.2,0.1)..(-0.8,-0.03)..(-0.4,-0.11)..(0,-0.15)..(0.4,-0.11)..(0.8,-0.03)..(1.2,0.1)); draw((-1,0.04)..(-0.5,0.12)..(0,0.16)..(0.5,0.12)..(1,0.04)); draw((0,2.4)--(0,-0.15)); draw((0,-0.15)--(0,-1.75), dashed); draw((0,-1.75)--(0,-2.25)); draw(ellipse((2,0), 1, 0.9)); draw((2.03,-0.02)--(2.9,-0.4)); [/asy]\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nLet's carefully analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the torus \\( T \\)\n\n- The torus \\( T \\) is generated by revolving a circle of radius \\( 3 \\) around an axis in the same plane.\n- The axis is at a distance \\( 6 \\) from the center of the circle.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- The circle's center is at some point, say \\( C \\), and the circle has radius \\( 3 \\).\n- The axis of revolution is a line in the plane, at a distance \\( 6 \\) from \\( C \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the major radius \\( R \\) of the torus\n\n- The **major radius** \\( R \\) is the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution.\n- Given: \\( R = 6 \\).\n\n### Step 3: The minor radius \\( r \\)\n\n- The **minor radius** of the circle being revolved is \\( 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Geometry of the torus\n\n- The torus is formed by revolving the circle of radius \\( 3 \\) around the axis at distance \\( R = 6 \\).\n- The surface of the torus is characterized by the major radius \\( R \\) and minor radius \\( r = 3 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Sphere \\( S \\)\n\n- Sphere \\( S \\) has radius \\( 11 \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: External tangency conditions\n\n- When \\( T \\) rests on the outside of \\( S \\), it is tangent along a circle with radius \\( r_i \\).\n- When \\( T \\) rests on the outside of \\( S \\), it is tangent along a circle with radius \\( r_o \\).\n\n**Note:** The problem states \"when \\( T \\) rests on the outside of \\( S \\), it is externally tangent to \\( S \\) along a circle with radius \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_o \\).**\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Understanding the tangent circles\n\n- The torus \\( T \\) and sphere \\( S \\) are tangent along a circle.\n- The circle of tangency on the sphere has radius \\( r_i \\) or \\( r_o \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Relationship between the radii\n\n- The circle of tangency on the sphere is a circle on the sphere's surface.\n- The circle's radius \\( r \\) relates to the distance between the centers and the sphere's radius.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Find the distances involved\n\n- The key is to find the **distance between the centers** of the sphere and the torus in each case.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Center of the torus\n\n- The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius \\( 3 \\) around an axis at distance \\( R = 6 \\).\n- The **center** of the torus (the circle's center) is at a distance \\( R = 6 \\) from the axis.\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Positioning the sphere\n\n- The sphere \\( S \\) has radius \\( 11 \\).\n- When the torus is tangent to the sphere externally, the **distance between their centers** is the sum of their radii.\n\n---\n\n### Step 12: The circle of tangency\n\n- The circle of tangency on the sphere has radius \\( r \\).\n- The circle on the sphere corresponds to a plane cutting the sphere at a distance \\( d \\) from the sphere's center, where:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{11^2 - d^2}\n\\]\n\n- Rearranged:\n\n\\[\nd = \\sqrt{11^2 - r^2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 13: Relationship between the torus and the sphere\n\n- The **center of the torus** is at a distance \\( R = 6 \\) from the axis.\n- The **center of the sphere** is at some point in the plane, say at distance \\( D \\) from the torus's center.\n\n- When tangent, the distance between centers is:\n\n\\[\nD \\pm R = 11 + r\n\\]\n\nor\n\n\\[\nD \\pm R = |11 - r|\n\\]\n\ndepending on whether the tangent is external or internal.\n\n---\n\n### Step 14: Determine \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_o \\)\n\n- For the **outer tangent** (the torus outside the sphere), the distance between centers is:\n\n\\[\nD = 11 + r_o\n\\]\n\n- For the **inner tangent** (the torus outside the sphere, but tangent along a circle), the distance is:\n\n\\[\nD = 11 - r_i\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 15: Express \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_o \\)\n\n- The circle of tangency on the sphere has radius:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{11^2 - d^2}\n\\]\n\n- The **distance \\( d \\)** from the sphere's center to the plane of the circle of tangency relates to the position of the torus's center.\n\n---\n\n### Step 16: Geometric relation for the circle of tangency\n\n- The circle of tangency on the sphere is at a distance \\( d \\) from the sphere's center.\n- The circle's radius:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{11^2 - d^2}\n\\]\n\n- The circle's radius on the sphere is also related to the geometry of the torus.\n\n---\n\n### Step 17: Relationship between \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_o \\)\n\n- The difference \\( r_i - r_o \\) is what we need to find.\n\n- From the previous steps, the key is to relate \\( r_i \\) and \\( r_o \\) to the distances between centers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 18: Final geometric relation\n\n- When the torus is outside the sphere, the **distance between centers** is:\n\n\\[\nD = 11 + r\n\\]\n\n- The **radius of the circle of tangency** on the sphere:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{11^2 - d^2}\n\\]\n\n- The **distance from the sphere's center to the plane** of the circle:\n\n\\[\nd\n\\]\n\n- The **radius of the circle of tangency** on the sphere:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{11^2 - d^2}\n\\]\n\n- The **relation between \\( r \\)** and the position of the torus:\n\n\\[\nr = R \\pm d\n\\]\n\nsince the circle of tangency is at a distance \\( d \\) from the sphere's center, and the torus's center is at a distance \\( R \\) from the axis.\n\n---\n\n### Step 19: Final calculation\n\n- The difference \\( r_i - r_o \\) corresponds to the difference in the radii of the circles of tangency, which are related to the distances:\n\n\\[\nr_i = \\sqrt{11^2 - d_i^2}\n\\]\n\\[\nr_o = \\sqrt{11^2 - d_o^2}\n\\]\n\n- The distances \\( d_i \\) and \\( d_o \\) are related to the positions of the torus relative to the sphere.\n\n- The key is that the difference in the radii of the tangent circles on the sphere is proportional to the difference in the distances \\( d_i \\) and \\( d_o \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 20: Final expression for \\( r_i - r_o \\)\n\n- The difference:\n\n\\[\nr_i - r_o = \\sqrt{121 - d_i^2} - \\sqrt{121 - d_o^2}\n\\]\n\n- Since the problem involves the torus's geometry, the difference in the distances \\( d_i \\) and \\( d_o \\) is related to the minor radius \\( r = 3 \\) and the major radius \\( R = 6 \\).\n\n- The key geometric insight is that the difference in the radii of the tangent circles is:\n\n\\[\nr_i - r_o = \\frac{2 R r}{\\text{distance between centers}}\n\\]\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nr_i - r_o = \\frac{2 \\times 6 \\times 3}{11} = \\frac{36}{11}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### **Final step:**\n\nThe difference \\( r_i - r_o = \\frac{36}{11} \\).\n\n- The fraction is in lowest terms: numerator \\( 36 \\), denominator \\( 11 \\), which are coprime.\n\n- The sum:\n\n\\[\nm + n = 36 + 11 = 47\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Final answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{47}\n\\]\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n47\n\n#The ground truth problem answer:\n\n127",
