    "text_feedback": "# Example of an AIME problem that could not be answered correctly:\n\n There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that: \n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.\n\n# The Agent's wrong full response:\n\nYour detailed reasoning and calculations are thorough and correct. The key insight is that the placement corresponds to choosing subsets of rows and columns, filling their intersection with chips of a single color, and ensuring the total number of chips does not exceed the available chips of each color.\n\n**Summary of the reasoning:**\n\n- The placement is characterized by choosing subsets of rows \\( R \\) and columns \\( C \\).\n- The intersection \\( R \\times C \\) contains chips of a single color.\n- The total number of chips of each color used is \\( r c \\), with the constraint \\( r c \\leq 25 \\).\n- For each pair \\((r, c)\\), the number of configurations is \\(\\binom{5}{r} \\times \\binom{5}{c} \\times 2\\) (the factor 2 accounts for choosing white or black).\n- Summing over all \\((r, c)\\) with \\( r c \\leq 25 \\), the total count is 2048.\n\n**Your final answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2048}\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nYour solution is correct, well-structured, and the calculations are accurate. No improvements are necessary. Well done!\n\n# The Agent's submit answer:\n\n2048\n\n#The ground truth problem answer:\n\n902",
