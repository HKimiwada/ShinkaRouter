 Let \(O=(0,0)\), \(A=\left(\tfrac{1}{2},0\right)\), and \(B=\left(0,\tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\) be points in the coordinate plane. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis. There is a unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\),  that does not belong to any segment from \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\). Then \(OC^2=\tfrac{p}{q}\), where \(p\) and \(q\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(p+q\).

# The Agent's wrong full response:

Let's carefully analyze the problem:

- Points:
  \[
  O = (0,0), \quad A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right), \quad B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).
  \]
- Segment family \(\mathcal{F}\): segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1, with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis (\(y=0\)) and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis (\(x=0\)), both in the first quadrant.

- The line segment \(\overline{AB}\) connects \(A\) and \(B\). Let's find its equation:

  \[
  A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right), \quad B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right).
  \]
  
  Slope:
  \[
  m_{AB} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{-\frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}.
  \]
  
  Equation:
  \[
  y - 0 = -\sqrt{3}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right) \implies y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
  \]

- The point \(C\) lies on \(\overline{AB}\), distinct from \(A\) and \(B\), and is characterized as the *only* point on \(\overline{AB}\) that does **not** belong to any segment in \(\mathcal{F}\) other than \(\overline{AB}\).

- For a point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\), the key is to understand when \(C\) can be part of a segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1 with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis.

---

### Step 1: Parameterize \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\)

Let \(C\) be at a parameter \(t \in (0,1)\):

\[
C = A + t(B - A) = \left(\frac{1}{2} + t\left(0 - \frac{1}{2}\right), 0 + t\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0\right)\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
x_C = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{t}{2} = \frac{1 - t}{2},
\]
\[
y_C = t \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t.
\]

---

### Step 2: Conditions for \(C\) to be in some segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of \(\mathcal{F}\)

Suppose \(P = (x_P, 0)\) on the \(x\)-axis, \(Q = (0, y_Q)\) on the \(y\)-axis, with the segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1:

\[
|PQ|^2 = (x_P - 0)^2 + (0 - y_Q)^2 = x_P^2 + y_Q^2 = 1.
\]

- The segment \(\overline{PQ}\) lies in the first quadrant, so \(x_P > 0\), \(y_Q > 0\).

- The line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) has endpoints on axes, so its parametric form:

\[
X(t) = x_P (1 - t), \quad Y(t) = y_Q t, \quad t \in [0,1].
\]

- The line segment \(\overline{PQ}\) passes through \(C\) if and only if \(C\) lies on the line segment between \(P\) and \(Q\). Since \(C\) is on the line segment, the ratios must satisfy:

\[
\frac{x_C - x_P}{-x_P} = \frac{y_C - 0}{y_Q} = t,
\]
and the point \(C\) corresponds to some \(t \in (0,1)\).

Alternatively, since \(P\) and \(Q\) are on axes:

\[
\text{Line } PQ: y = -\frac{y_Q}{x_P} x + y_Q.
\]

- For \(C = (x_C, y_C)\) to be on this line:

\[
y_C = -\frac{y_Q}{x_P} x_C + y_Q,
\]
which rearranges to:

\[
y_C = y_Q \left(1 - \frac{x_C}{x_P}\right).
\]

- Since \(x_P, y_Q > 0\), and \(x_C, y_C\) are known, the key is whether such \(x_P, y_Q\) exist satisfying:

\[
x_P^2 + y_Q^2 = 1,
\]
and

\[
y_C = y_Q \left(1 - \frac{x_C}{x_P}\right).
\]

---

### Step 3: Express \(y_Q\) in terms of \(x_P\):

\[
y_Q = \frac{y_C}{1 - \frac{x_C}{x_P}} = \frac{y_C x_P}{x_P - x_C}.
\]

Since \(x_P > 0\), \(x_C = \frac{1 - t}{2} > 0\) for \(t \in (0,1)\), and \(x_P - x_C > 0\) (to keep \(y_Q > 0\)).

Now, the length condition:

\[
x_P^2 + y_Q^2 = 1,
\]
becomes:

\[
x_P^2 + \left(\frac{y_C x_P}{x_P - x_C}\right)^2 = 1.
\]

Define:

\[
X = x_P, \quad x_C = c_x = \frac{1 - t}{2}, \quad y_C = c_y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t.
\]

Then:

\[
X^2 + \left(\frac{c_y X}{X - c_x}\right)^2 = 1.
\]

Multiply through by \((X - c_x)^2\):

\[
X^2 (X - c_x)^2 + c_y^2 X^2 = (X - c_x)^2.
\]

---

### Step 4: Simplify the key equation

Expand:

\[
X^2 (X^2 - 2 c_x X + c_x^2) + c_y^2 X^2 = X^2 - 2 c_x X + c_x^2.
\]

Left side:

\[
X^4 - 2 c_x X^3 + c_x^2 X^2 + c_y^2 X^2,
\]
which simplifies to:

\[
X^4 - 2 c_x X^3 + (c_x^2 + c_y^2) X^2.
\]

Right side:

\[
X^2 - 2 c_x X + c_x^2.
\]

Bring all to one side:

\[
X^4 - 2 c_x X^3 + (c_x^2 + c_y^2) X^2 - X^2 + 2 c_x X - c_x^2 = 0,
\]
which simplifies to:

\[
X^4 - 2 c_x X^3 + (c_x^2 + c_y^2 - 1) X^2 + 2 c_x X - c_x^2 = 0.
\]

---

### Step 5: Recognize the critical point

The key is that for \(C\) to **not** belong to any segment \(\overline{PQ}\), the above quadratic in \(X\) must have **no** positive solution \(X > c_x\). The problem states that \(C\) is the *only* point on \(\overline{AB}\) with this property, so the critical case occurs when the quadratic has a **double root** at some \(X\), i.e., discriminant zero.

But more straightforwardly, the point \(C\) is *not* in any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) if and only if **no** positive \(X\) satisfies the above equation with \(X > c_x\).

The boundary case occurs when the quadratic has a **single** solution at some \(X\), i.e., the minimal \(X\) for which the quadratic is zero.

---

### Step 6: Find the point \(C\) where the segment just ceases to be covered

The critical point occurs when the quadratic in \(X\) has a **double root**:

\[
\Delta = 0,
\]
where \(\Delta\) is the discriminant of the quadratic in \(X\).

The quadratic:

\[
X^4 - 2 c_x X^3 + (c_x^2 + c_y^2 - 1) X^2 + 2 c_x X - c_x^2 = 0.
\]

---

### Step 7: Use the geometric insight

Alternatively, note that the set of all segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1 with \(P\) on the \(x\)-axis and \(Q\) on the \(y\)-axis is characterized by the family of lines:

\[
x / a + y / b = 1,
\]
where \(a, b > 0\), and the length of the segment between \((a, 0)\) and \((0, b)\) is:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 1.
\]

- The segment endpoints are \((a, 0)\) and \((0, b)\).

- The line segment between these points:

\[
\text{Line: } y = -\frac{b}{a} x + b,
\]
and the length condition:

\[
a^2 + b^2 = 1.
\]

- The point \(C\) lies on \(\overline{AB}\), which has equation:

\[
y = -\sqrt{3} x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

- For \(C\) to be on some segment \(\overline{PQ}\), the point \(C\) must satisfy:

\[
C_y = -\frac{b}{a} C_x + b,
\]
or equivalently:

\[
b = \frac{C_y + \frac{b}{a} C_x}{1}.
\]

But more straightforwardly, the minimal distance from \(C\) to the family of lines \(y = -\frac{b}{a} x + b\) with \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) determines whether \(C\) is covered.

---

### Step 8: Geometric interpretation

The set of all segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1 with endpoints on axes forms a family of lines:

\[
\text{Line: } y = -m x + b,
\]
with \(a, b > 0\), \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), and the segment endpoints are \((a, 0)\) and \((0, b)\).

The length of the segment:

\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 1,
\]
which is consistent.

The point \(C\) is *not* in any such segment if the perpendicular distance from \(C\) to all these lines exceeds the maximum possible for segments of length 1.

The critical case occurs when \(C\) lies exactly on the boundary of the union of all such segments, i.e., when the minimal distance from \(C\) to the family of lines is exactly the length of the segment.

---

### **Key insight:**

The point \(C\) is *not* covered if and only if the minimal distance from \(C\) to the family of lines \(y = -m x + b\) with \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) exceeds the maximum possible for segments of length 1.

The boundary occurs when \(C\) is exactly on the "edge" of the union of all such segments.

---

### Step 9: Find the point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) with the property

From the previous steps, the critical point \(C\) occurs when the line from \(O\) to \(C\) has a length squared:

\[
OC^2 = x_C^2 + y_C^2.
\]

Recall:

\[
x_C = \frac{1 - t}{2}, \quad y_C = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t.
\]

Express \(OC^2\):

\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1 - t}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t\right)^2 = \frac{(1 - t)^2}{4} + \frac{3 t^2}{4} = \frac{(1 - t)^2 + 3 t^2}{4}.
\]

Simplify numerator:

\[
(1 - t)^2 + 3 t^2 = 1 - 2 t + t^2 + 3 t^2 = 1 - 2 t + 4 t^2.
\]

Thus:

\[
OC^2 = \frac{1 - 2 t + 4 t^2}{4}.
\]

---

### Step 10: Find the critical \(t\)

The point \(C\) is the *only* point on \(\overline{AB}\) that cannot be covered by any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) in \(\mathcal{F}\). This occurs when the line from \(O\) to \(C\) is tangent to the "envelope" of the family of segments.

From the geometric considerations, the critical point occurs when the distance from \(O\) to \(C\) equals the minimal length of the segment \(\overline{PQ}\) that can cover \(C\). Since the segments are of length 1, the critical point occurs when the distance from \(O\) to \(C\) is maximized under the constraints.

Alternatively, the problem reduces to finding \(t\) such that the point \(C\) is just outside the reach of any segment of length 1 with endpoints on axes.

---

### **Final step:**

From the previous derivations, the critical point occurs when the point \(C\) is at a position where the segment \(\overline{AB}\) is tangent to the "coverage" boundary.

The key is that the point \(C\) is at a distance from \(O\):

\[
OC^2 = \frac{1 - 2 t + 4 t^2}{4}.
\]

To find the specific \(t\), note that the point \(C\) is on the line \(AB\):

\[
y = -\sqrt{3} x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Expressed in terms of \(t\):

\[
x = \frac{1 - t}{2}, \quad y = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t.
\]

Substitute into the line:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} t = -\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1 - t}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
\sqrt{3} t = -\sqrt{3} (1 - t) + \sqrt{3}.
\]

Simplify RHS:

\[
-\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} t + \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3} t,
\]
which simplifies to:

\[
\sqrt{3} t = \sqrt{3} t,
\]
a tautology, indicating that any \(t \in (0,1)\) corresponds to a point on \(AB\).

Now, the critical point occurs when the distance from \(O\) to \(C\) equals the maximum length of the segment that can reach \(C\). The maximum length of such a segment is 1, and the minimal distance from \(O\) to the line \(PQ\) is related to the perpendicular distance from \(O\) to the line passing through \(C\).

Alternatively, the problem reduces to the following:

- The point \(C\) is the point on \(AB\) where the distance \(OC\) is maximized such that \(C\) is just outside the reach of any segment \(\overline{PQ}\) of length 1.

From the previous expression:

\[
OC^2 = \frac{1 - 2 t + 4 t^2}{4}.
\]

To find the maximum \(OC^2\) for \(t \in (0,1)\), take derivative with respect to \(t\):

\[
\frac{d}{dt} OC^2 = \frac{-2 + 8 t}{4} = \frac{-2 + 8 t}{4}.
\]

Set derivative to zero:

\[
-2 + 8 t = 0 \implies 8 t = 2 \implies t = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

At \(t = \frac{1}{4}\):

\[
OC^2 = \frac{1 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 4 \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2}{4} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{16}}{4} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}}{4} = \frac{\frac{4}{4} - \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4}}{4} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{4} = \frac{3}{16}.
\]

Thus,

\[
OC^2 = \frac{3}{16}.
\]

Expressed as a fraction:

\[
OC^2 = \frac{3}{16}.
\]

The problem states:

\[
OC^2 = \frac{p}{q},
\]
with \(p, q\) coprime. Here, \(p=3\), \(q=16\).

Finally, compute \(p+q\):

\[
p + q = 3 + 16 = 19.
\]
